- I am a research scientist at
[INRIA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Institute_for_Research_in_Computer_Science_and_Automation)
working on the [POEMS](https://poems.ensta-paris.fr) team.
- Interested (broadly) in numerical methods for partial and integral equations.
- I enjoy developing novel algorithms and software for scientific computing.
- These days I code mostly in Julia, but I was also a big fan of C++ and Matlab
  in the past.
